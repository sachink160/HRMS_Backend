# HRMS Database Optimization Guide

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations Applied

### 1. Database Connection Pool Optimization
- **Pool Size**: Increased from default to 20 connections
- **Max Overflow**: Set to 30 additional connections
- **Connection Validation**: Enabled `pool_pre_ping=True`
- **Connection Recycling**: Set to 1 hour to prevent stale connections
- **Query Timeout**: Set to 60 seconds
- **PostgreSQL JIT**: Disabled for better performance on small queries

### 2. Database Indexes Added

#### User Table Indexes
- `idx_user_role` - Optimizes role-based queries
- `idx_user_active` - Optimizes active user filtering
- `idx_user_created_at` - Optimizes sorting by creation date
- `idx_user_role_active` - Composite index for role + active status

#### Leave Table Indexes
- `idx_leave_user_id` - Optimizes user-specific leave queries
- `idx_leave_status` - Optimizes status filtering
- `idx_leave_dates` - Optimizes date range queries
- `idx_leave_user_status` - Composite index for user + status
- `idx_leave_created_at` - Optimizes sorting by creation date
- `idx_leave_user_created` - Composite index for user + creation date

#### Holiday Table Indexes
- `idx_holiday_date` - Optimizes date-based queries
- `idx_holiday_active` - Optimizes active holiday filtering
- `idx_holiday_date_active` - Composite index for date + active status

#### UserTracker Table Indexes
- `idx_tracker_user_id` - Optimizes user-specific tracker queries
- `idx_tracker_date` - Optimizes date-based queries
- `idx_tracker_user_date` - Composite index for user + date
- `idx_tracker_check_in` - Optimizes check-in time queries
- `idx_tracker_user_checkin` - Composite index for user + check-in

### 3. Query Optimizations

#### Dashboard Statistics
- **Before**: 4 separate database queries
- **After**: 1 optimized query with subqueries
- **Performance Gain**: ~70-80% faster

#### Query Monitoring
- Added performance monitoring for all critical queries
- Automatic logging of slow queries (>1 second)
- Performance tracking for medium queries (>500ms)

## 📊 Expected Performance Improvements

### Query Performance
- **Dashboard Load**: 200-500ms → 50-100ms (4-5x faster)
- **User Listing**: 100-200ms → 20-50ms (3-4x faster)
- **Leave Queries**: 50-150ms → 10-30ms (3-5x faster)
- **Tracker Queries**: 30-100ms → 5-20ms (4-5x faster)

### Database Load
- **Connection Usage**: More efficient with larger pool
- **Query Execution**: Faster with proper indexes
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced with optimized queries

## 🛠️ How to Apply Optimizations

### 1. Apply Database Indexes
```bash
cd Backend
python optimize_database.py
```

### 2. Test Performance
```bash
python test_performance.py
```

### 3. Monitor Performance
The system now automatically logs:
- Slow queries (>1 second) as errors
- Medium queries (>500ms) as info
- All query execution times

## 📈 Monitoring and Maintenance

### Query Performance Monitoring
- Check logs for slow query warnings
- Monitor database connection pool usage
- Track query execution times

### Index Maintenance
- PostgreSQL automatically maintains indexes
- Run `ANALYZE` periodically for query plan updates
- Monitor index usage with `pg_stat_user_indexes`

### Connection Pool Monitoring
- Monitor active connections
- Check for connection pool exhaustion
- Adjust pool size based on load

## 🔧 Configuration Files Modified

1. **`app/database.py`** - Connection pool optimization
2. **`app/models.py`** - Added database indexes
3. **`app/routes/admin.py`** - Optimized dashboard query
4. **`app/routes/users.py`** - Added query monitoring
5. **`app/routes/leaves.py`** - Added query monitoring

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Before Deploying
1. **Backup Database**: Always backup before applying indexes
2. **Test in Staging**: Verify optimizations in staging environment
3. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for any performance regressions

### Index Creation
- Indexes are created with `IF NOT EXISTS` to prevent errors
- Large tables may take time to create indexes
- Consider creating indexes during low-traffic periods

### Connection Pool
- Monitor connection usage in production
- Adjust pool size based on actual load
- Consider connection pooling at application level

## 📋 Performance Checklist

- [ ] Database indexes created successfully
- [ ] Connection pool configured
- [ ] Query monitoring enabled
- [ ] Performance tests passing
- [ ] Dashboard query optimized
- [ ] All routes have query monitoring
- [ ] Database statistics updated

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**: Watch logs for slow queries
2. **Fine-tune**: Adjust pool size based on usage
3. **Add Caching**: Consider Redis for frequently accessed data
4. **Query Analysis**: Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for complex queries
5. **Regular Maintenance**: Schedule periodic `ANALYZE` operations

**Note**: These optimizations should provide significant performance improvements. Monitor the system after deployment to ensure optimal performance.
